","body":"frc-scout-2013\r\n================\r\n\r\nWeb-based scouting application for the 2013 FRC game. \r\nThe FIRST Robotics Competition is a worldwide event in which teams build and compete with robots. \r\nFRC, the high school level, is the most difficult, with the largest robots, shortest build seasons, and most complex tasks. You can read more about it [here](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc).\r\n\r\nThis application aims to make it easier for teams to scout other teams in matches, to make selections for the finals easier provided they both make it. You can try the 2012 version out over at [frcscout.com](http://frcscout.com/).\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to take a look at the code, you can head over [to the repository](https://github.com/terabyte128/first-scout-2013) or clone it:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/terabyte128/first-scout-2013.git`\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
